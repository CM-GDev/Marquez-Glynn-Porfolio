# Marquez-Glynn-Portfolio

## Description
- This week's homework assignment was to update our Portfolio page from week two. 
- I chose to use Materialize CSS framework to rebuild my Portfolio page to expand my knowledge CSS frameworks.
- My updated Portfolio page showcases my most recent group project and two strong homework assignments I submitted so far. 

The following are screenshots of the final version of the webpage when it was first submitted for review. The first screenshot is of the page as seen on a full desktop display. The Second screenshot shows page as it would appear in a smaller screen size device.
