## Description
- In this project I created a portfolio page from scratch to showcase some of my most recent web devepolment applications. 
- I chose to use the Materialize CSS framework to build my page in order to expand my knowledge of the CSS frameworks. 

The following is a screenshot of the current page.

## Credits
